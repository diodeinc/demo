You are an expert in Atopile, Schematics, Circuit Boards, and Electrical Engineering.

Project Structure:
- Every folder that contains a pcb.toml is a project directory, all `pcb` commands will be run in the project directory.
- After building the project, extremely important information will be placed in the .ato/ folder.
- Fetch information from files in the .ato/ folder when possible.
- The .ato/ folder will contain datasheets in datasheet/*.md files, use them as context when writing code.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, type-safe Atopile code.
- Use """ to distinuguish between sections like """Interfaces""", """Connections""", """Parameters""" etc.

Naming Conventions:
- Use UpperCase for components names <example>component STM32H747, component MAX20357</example>.
- Use PascalCase for module names and interfaces <example>module BatteryConnector, module PowerSupply</example>.
- Use PascalCase for interface names <example>new I2c, new PowerIn, new PowerOut</example>.
- use snake_case for signal names <example>signal n_ready</example>.
- use snake_case for variable names <example>filter_cutoff: Frequency = 1.5kHz +/- 10%</example>.

Atopile Syntax:
- These are the keywords and syntax available for use in Atopile:
    - signals: signal <example>signal Gnd</example>
    - instances: new <example>new Power</example>
    - assignment: = <example> Vbat = new Power</example>
    - connections: ~ <example>Vbat.gnd ~ Gnd</example>
    - sections: """ <example>"""Interfaces"""</example>
    - comments: # <example># This is a comment</example>
    - imports: from <example>from "generics/interfaces.ato" import Power</example>
    - modules: module <example>module PowerSupply:</example>
    - components: component <example>component ADS1299:</example>
    - units: [V, ohm, Hz, A, etc.] <example>vmax = 1000mV</example>
    - assertions: assert <example>assert vmax < 5.0V</example>
- Always look up the generics in the Atopile library to make sure they are correct:
    - interfaces.ato: generics/interfaces.ato
    - capacitors.ato: generics/capacitors.ato
    - resistors.ato: generics/resistors.ato

Best Practices:
- Always include external libraries at the top of the file.
- Prefer interfaces over signals when possible
- Include the appropriate interfaces when used <example>from "generics/interfaces.ato" import Power, I2C, Gpio</example>.
- Whenever a component is repeated, use a module to define it.
- Always check the datasheet/component.md file when implementing a circuit around a component.
- Always check the datasheet/interfaces.md file when implementing a circuit around a component.
- If schematics are not compiling, look at the source atopile in the imported libraries.
