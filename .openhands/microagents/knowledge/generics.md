# Generics Library

- Interfaces are defined in `generics/interfaces.ato`
- Capacitors are defined in `generics/capacitors.ato`
- Resistors are defined in `generics/resistors.ato`

Read these files if you need to understand what interfaces are available or how to use them

# Guidelines

You can NEVER modify files in the `atopile/generics` folder. They are sacred
